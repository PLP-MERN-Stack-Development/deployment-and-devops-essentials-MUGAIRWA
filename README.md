# Deployment and DevOps for MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on deploying a full MERN stack application to production, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and setting up monitoring for your application.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Prepare your MERN application for production deployment
2. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform
3. Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
5. Implement monitoring and maintenance strategies

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `Week7-Assignment.md` file
4. Use the provided templates and configuration files as a starting point

## Files Included

- `Week7-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflow templates
- `deployment/`: Deployment configuration files and scripts
- `.env.example`: Example environment variable templates
- `monitoring/`: Monitoring configuration examples

## Requirements

- A completed MERN stack application from previous weeks
- Accounts on the following services:
  - GitHub
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - Render, Railway, or Heroku (for backend)
  - Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (for frontend)
- Basic understanding of CI/CD concepts

## Deployment Platforms

### Backend Deployment Options
- **Render**: Easy to use, free tier available
- **Railway**: Developer-friendly, generous free tier
- **Heroku**: Well-established, extensive documentation

### Frontend Deployment Options
- **Vercel**: Optimized for React apps, easy integration
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites, good CI/CD
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, integrated with GitHub

## CI/CD Pipeline

The assignment includes templates for setting up GitHub Actions workflows:
- `frontend-ci.yml`: Tests and builds the React application
- `backend-ci.yml`: Tests the Express.js backend
- `frontend-cd.yml`: Deploys the frontend to your chosen platform
- `backend-cd.yml`: Deploys the backend to your chosen platform

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub repository with MERN stack application
2. Accounts on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)
3. MongoDB Atlas database

### Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Set build command: `npm install`
3. Set start command: `npm start`
4. Add environment variables from `.env.example`
5. Deploy

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables from `.env.example`
5. Deploy

### CI/CD Setup
1. GitHub Actions workflows are configured in `.github/workflows/`
2. Set up repository secrets for Vercel and Render API keys
3. Workflows will automatically deploy on push to main and releases

## Deployed Applications
